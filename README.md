Test project for oni-ecology

**TODO**: Write a proper description

## Building the project

### Building and Testing the Lot

You can build and test the content with:

``` shell
# Run from the root of the repo checkout:
bin/ci.common
```

This should run the stuff that CI should be testing, CI might fail even though this
passes locally because CI might do other stuff like publish artifacts, have some environment
setup to do etc...
